# Walmart Sales Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

## Overview
This project is dedicated to applying advanced data analysis techniques to build a predictive model for weekly sales at Walmart. The strategic objective is to improve inventory turnover and reduce waste through precise optimization, directly impacting operational efficiency and profitability.

## Project Structure
-   `data/`: Contains the sales and relevant external datasets used for analysis and modeling.
-   `code/`: Python scripts/Jupyter notebooks for data processing, model building, forecasting, and optimization logic.
-   `report/`: A detailed report summarizing findings, methodologies, model performance, and optimization strategies.

## Features & Functionality
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyzes historical sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
    * Investigates the impact of various factors (e.g., holidays, promotions, store type, economic indicators) on weekly sales.
    * Visualizes key patterns and insights to inform model development.
2.  **Weekly Sales Predictive Modeling:**
    * Develops and evaluates predictive models to forecast future weekly sales with high accuracy.
    * Handles time-series characteristics such as trends and seasonality.
3.  **Inventory Optimization:**
    * Deploys the predictive sales model to inform inventory management decisions.
    * Implements strategies to optimize inventory levels, aiming to improve turnover rates and minimize overstocking/understocking.
4.  **Waste Reduction:**
    * By achieving precise inventory optimization, the project aims to significantly reduce waste associated with expired, damaged, or unsellable excess stock.
